A web service allows different systems to talk to each other over the
internet. The client sends a message and waits for a response from
the server.The server receives the message, and the web service
performs an action. Then, a message is sent back to the client. For
ex: you are in a coffee shop and you want to buy a cup of coffee. But
You're in a different country, say, Belgium, and don't speak the
language. How are you going to communicate and get what you want? So,
you need help from someone who is able to translate what you want and
to get your coffee. So, you turn to your friend who happens to speak
both English and French.You're able to communicate to your friend in
English. So he translates to shopkeeper and gets u tea. In this
scenario, you are the client sending a message in a language that
your friend, the web service, can understand.The web service is able
to communicate with the server and get the task completed. Data is
transferred between client and server with a common web language,
like XML. Each application can be written in two completely different
languages, like .NET or Java, but they can use XML to communicate the
data they need. There are two main types of web services, SOAP and
RESTful.
